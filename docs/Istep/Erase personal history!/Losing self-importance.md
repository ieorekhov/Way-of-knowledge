>Self-importance is our greatest enemy. Think about it. What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone

>He said that the most effective strategy was worked out by the seers of the Conquest, the unquestionable masters of stalking. It consists of six elements that interplay with one another. Five of them are called the attributes of warriorship: control, discipline, forbearance, timing, and will. They pertain to the world of the warrior who is fighting to lose self-importance. The sixth element, which is perhaps the most important of all, pertains to the outside world and is called the petty tyrant.

1. Control  
>To tune the spirit when someone is trampling on you is called control.
2. Discipline  
>To gather all this information while they are beat ing you up is called discipline
3. Forbearance  
>Forbearance is to wait patiently, no rush, no anxiety, a simple, joyful holding back of what is due.  

>As long as the warrior has control, discipline, and timing, forbearance assures giving whatever is due to whoever deserves it.  
4. Timing
>Don Juan said that timing is the quality that governs the release of all that is held back. Control, discipline, and forbearance are like a dam behind which everything is pooled. Timing is the gate in the dam. 
5. Will
>„Usually, only four attributes are played,” he went on. „The fifth, will, is always saved for an ultimate confrontation, when warriors are facing the firing squad, so to speak.”  
>„Why is it done that way?” „Because wilt belongs to another sphere, the unknown. The other four belong to the known, exactly where the petty tyrants are lodged. In fact, what turns human beings into petty tyrants is precisely the obsessive manipulation of the known.” Don Juan explained that the interplay of all the five attributes of warriorship is done only by seers who are also impeccable warriors and have mastery over will. Such an interplay is a supreme maneuver that cannot be performed on the daily human stage.
